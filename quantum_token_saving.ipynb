    "#### 💡 What Do These Numbers Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qubits (133)**: This is the number of quantum bits the device has. More qubits allow for more complex quantum circuits.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Two-Qubit (2Q) Gate Errors**: \n",
    "  - Quantum gates (like CNOT) that act on two qubits are more error-prone than single-qubit gates.\n",
    "  - The **\"best\"** error rate ($1.33 \\times 10^{-3}$) is the lowest measured error across the chip.\n",
    "  - The **\"layered\"** error ($6.35 \\times 10^{-3}$) reflects the average error when running layered circuits across the full device. This is more realistic for actual use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CLOPS (210K)**: Stands for *Circuit Layer Operations Per Second*. It measures how fast the device can execute repeated quantum circuits. Higher CLOPS means faster experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pending Jobs (5,588)**: This high number shows that `ibm-torino` is very popular! Jobs are queued, so your circuit may wait before running.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heron r1 Architecture**: This is part of IBM’s newer Heron processor family, which features improved gate fidelities and connectivity compared to older chips.\n",

    "#### 💡 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slightly Fewer Qubits, Slightly Higher Errors**: Compared to `ibm-torino`, `ibm_brisbane` has fewer qubits (127) and slightly higher layered error rates, but it’s still a powerful device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher CLOPS (289K)**: Despite more errors, `ibm_brisbane` runs circuits faster than `ibm-torino`. This makes it better for running many short experiments quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lower Queue (4,239 jobs)**: While still busy, it has fewer pending jobs than `ibm-torino`, so your circuits might run sooner.\n",
