## CPLEX Results Explanation

When solving a problem using CPLEX with a time limit of 1 hour, the following results were obtained:

```json
{
    "gap": 0.99999999999,
    "time": 3614.973722219467,
    "status": "time limit exceeded",
    "variables": 86,
    "non-zero terms": 563,
    "nodes": 295880675,
    "iterations": 855015623
}
```


### Term Descriptions

Each term in the CPLEX results provides specific information about the optimization process:

- **Gap** (`gap: 0.99999999999`):
  - The **gap** represents the difference between the best-known solution (the incumbent solution) and the best possible solution (the lower bound), expressed as a fraction of the incumbent solution.
  - A gap close to `1` (like `0.99999999999`) indicates that CPLEX did not find a solution close to optimal or even feasible within the allotted time. This often results from a combination of complex constraints, large problem size, or insufficient time.

- **Time** (`time: 3614.973722219467`):
  - The **time** is the total number of seconds that CPLEX spent attempting to solve the problem. Here, the process took approximately `3614.97` seconds, which slightly exceeds the one-hour time limit (1 hour = 3600 seconds).

- **Status** (`status: "time limit exceeded"`):
  - The **status** indicates why CPLEX stopped. In this case, it stopped due to reaching the time limit, rather than finding an optimal solution or determining infeasibility.

- **Variables** (`variables: 86`):
  - This is the count of **decision variables** in the model. These are the variables that CPLEX tries to optimize based on the objective function and constraints.

- **Non-Zero Terms** (`non-zero terms: 563`):
  - The **non-zero terms** refer to the count of non-zero entries in the constraint matrix. Only non-zero values impact the constraints, so this number gives insight into the model's sparsity (fewer non-zero terms) or density (more non-zero terms).

- **Nodes** (`nodes: 295880675`):
  - **Nodes** indicate the total number of nodes explored in the branch-and-bound tree. Each node represents a subproblem that CPLEX evaluates in the search for an optimal solution. A high node count, such as `295880675`, usually points to a complex problem with a large search space.

- **Iterations** (`iterations: 855015623`):
  - **Iterations** denote the number of steps CPLEX took within the simplex or barrier algorithm to solve the problem. High iteration counts are common in challenging problems with complex constraints or a vast solution space.

### Summary

These results reflect CPLEX's performance on this problem:
- A very high **gap** and **time limit exceeded** status indicate that CPLEX struggled to find a solution close to optimal.
- The large number of **nodes** and **iterations** shows the extent of the search space explored by CPLEX.
- The **variables** and **non-zero terms** describe the size and sparsity of the modelâ€™s constraint matrix.

This feedback can guide adjustments, such as:
- Extending the time limit,
- Improving initial solutions, or
- Tuning parameters for better convergence.
